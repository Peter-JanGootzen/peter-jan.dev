        <h1>Hi.</h1>
        <p>My name is Peter-Jan and I am a Research Student at IBM Research Zurich üá®üá≠ and VU University Amsterdam üá≥üá±.</p>
        <p><a href="#lfw" class="rainbow rainbow_text_animated">Looking for work!</a><a href="#lfw"> ‚¨áÔ∏è</a></p>
        <p>Below you will find a list of interesting stuff I work(ed) on. You might also enjoy my <a href="https://github.com/Peter-JanGootzen">Github</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-jango">Linkedin</a>.</p>
        <h2>DPFS: DPU-Powered File System Virtualization (Research ongoing)</h2>
        <p>
            This research started during my IBM Research Zurich internship and has grown into a full open-source project that has sparked significant interest in and outside of IBM.
            I am currently continuing the research for my MSc thesis.</p>
        <p>
            The DPFS framework allows Cloud and datacenter operators to provide virtualized file system services to tenants using DPU-offloading.
            With DPFS the complete file system implementation runs on the CPU complex of the DPU.
            Tenants consume the file system through the `virtio-fs` device that the DPU exposes over PCIe (multi-tenancy via SR-IOV).</p>
        </p>

        </ul>
        <h4>Noteable things I did for this research:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>uncovered undocumented features in our DPU's firmware and software, and added features and bug fixes to said software</li>
            <li>implemented the <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5661">Networked File System (NFS) v4.1 RFC</a> in userspace</li>
            <li>ported the <a href="https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse">lowlevel libfuse file system API</a> to our framework</li>
            <li>Linux kernel debugging and <a href="https://github.com/Peter-JanGootzen/linux">patch development</a></li>
            <li>a bit of RDMA debugging and coding</li>
            <li>performed many low-level performance optimization iterations</li>
            <li>created an extensive set reproducible experiments</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Advanced projects for university courses</h2>
        <p>Sadly most of these contain no links to source code or report as to prevent plagarism for future students.<p>
